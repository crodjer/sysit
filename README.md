## About
System resources overview within 50 characters. Relies on
[sysinfo](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/sysinfo) to get all the relevant system
information.

## Install
If you are on Arch, install via Aur: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sysit-bin/

Otherwise, build it:
```
cargo install sysit
```
or download the pre-built binaries for the
[latest release](https://github.com/crodjer/sysit/releases/latest).


## Reasoning
The ability to quickly see basic system information without needing a
context switch can be useful. `sysit` is easy to incorporate in the
various status bars - such as that of `tmux`, `i3`/`sway` etc.

## Understanding the output
M: Memory Usage
C: CPU Usage and Frequency
T: Temperature for the hottest sensor.
P: Network Ping

# Usage

## From the console
Simply type `sysit` for a quick glance at the system information.
```
rohan in mir in sysit on ÓÇ† master is üì¶ v0.1.0 via ü¶Ä v1.49.0
at 17:45:13 ‚ùØ sysit
M: 17% | C: 19% @  600 MHz | T: 60¬∞C | P: 4.12 ms
```

This can also be used with a desktop manager's applets. For example,
Xfce's `genmon`.

## Continuous Monitoring
### Watch Mode
Works as if `watch sysit`. Can be used within tmux status line for
continuous monitoring. Eg:
```tmux.conf
set -g status-right '#[fg=yellow] #(sysit -wi 2) #[fg=colour235,bg=colour252,bold] %a %d %b %H:%M:%S #[fg=colour252,bg=colour238,nobold]#[fg=colour245,bg=colour238,bold]'
```
Watch mode with `sysit -wi 2` has a benefit of maintaining a single
process. Just using plain `sysit` command will also work, but that'd
mean tmux spawns a new process every time.

### Log Mode
At times it can be handy to log system stats, for instance, while
benchmarking.

For usage details, try --help

Understanding the output:

  M: Memory Usage{n}
  C: CPU Usage and Frequency{n}
  T: Temperature for the hottest sensor{n}
  P: Ping (only available in the long running log/watch mode)

USAGE:
    sysit [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -c, --colors
            force output to be always colorized

    -f, --frequency
            show CPU frequency

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -l, --log
            run in log mode (will continuously append a row to standard output)

        --no-colors
            force output to be never colorized

    -V, --version
            Print version information

    -w, --watch
            run in watch mode (as if running with the watch command)

OPTIONS:
    -i, --interval <INTERVAL>
            update interval in seconds for watch/log mode [default: 1]

        --ping-host <PING_HOST>
            host to use for testing the ping [default: 1.0.0.1]

        --threshold-cpu-high <THRESHOLD_CPU_HIGH>
