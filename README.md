## About
System resources overview within 40 characters. Relies on
[sysinfo](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/sysinfo) to get all the relevant system
information.

sysit
Get system resources overview in 40 characters. For usage details, try --help

USAGE:
    sysit [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -c, --colors       force output to be always colorized
    -h, --help         Prints help information
    -l, --log          run in log mode (will continuously append a row to standard output)
        --no-colors    force output to be never colorized
    -V, --version      Prints version information
    -w, --watch        run in watch mode (will act as if running with the watch)

OPTIONS:
    -i, --interval <interval>
            update interval in seconds for watch/log mode [default: 1]

        --threshold-cpu-high <threshold-cpu-high>
            the threshold for high cpu usage (higher values will be rendered in red) [default:
            80.0]

        --threshold-cpu-medium <threshold-cpu-medium>
            the threshold for medium cpu usage (higher values will be rendered in yellow) [default:
            50.0]

        --threshold-memory-high <threshold-memory-high>
            the threshold for high memory usage (higher values will be rendered in red) [default:
            80.0]

        --threshold-memory-medium <threshold-memory-medium>
            the threshold for medium memory usage (higher values will be rendered in yellow)
            [default: 50.0]

        --threshold-temp-hot <threshold-temp-hot>
            the threshold for high temperature (higher values will be rendered in red) [default:
            75.0]

        --threshold-temp-warm <threshold-temp-warm>
            the threshold for warm temperature (higher values will be rendered in yellow) [default:
            55.0]

```

## Reasoning
When working headlessly with tmux or even when working on a desktop,
being able to quickly see basic system informatino can be useful.
There's `btm` (also based on `sysinfo`, `heim`), but you have to
actively switch to them.

For instance, when overclocking the RPi, it makes sense to monitor the
CPU frequency and temperature. Inspired by [cpu-temp-speed](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/manjaro-arm/packages/community/cpu-temp-speed)
on Manjaro, which has been quite useful in tuning the overclock and
colling system configuration.

# Usage

## From the console
Simply type `sysit` for a quick glance at the system information.
```
rohan in mir in sysit on ÓÇ† master is üì¶ v0.1.0 via ü¶Ä v1.49.0
at 17:45:13 ‚ùØ sysit
M: 8% | C: 0% @ 1100 MHz | T: 54¬∞C
```

This can also be used with a desktop manager's applets. For example,
Xfce's `genmon`.

## Continuous Monitoring
### Watch Mode
Works as if `watch sysit`. Can be used within tmux status line for
continuous monitoring. Eg:
```tmux.conf
set -g status-right '#[fg=yellow] #(sysit -wi 2) #[fg=colour235,bg=colour252,bold] %a %d %b %H:%M:%S #[fg=colour252,bg=colour238,nobold]#[fg=colour245,bg=colour238,bold]'
```
Watch mode with `sysit -wi 2` has a benefit of maintaining a single
process. Just using plain `sysit` command will also work, but that'd
mean tmux spawns a new process every time.

### Log Mode
At times it can be handy to log system stats, for instance, while
benchmarking.
